Step 1: Since nx is 1, X bits would get inverted.
X is 9 and in binary it would be: 0000 1001. After flipping the bits,
X would be equal to: 1111 0110.

Step 2: Since f is 1, we would do the operation ADD X+Y. 
Our current X is 1111 0110 and our current Y is 5 or 0000 0101.
Adding those two together yields: 1111 1011. 

Step 3: In the last step, since no is 1, the current output would become 
inverted. 1111 1011 would become 0000 0100 or 4.

This proves that this combination of control flags would yield the output
X-Y or 9-5.
